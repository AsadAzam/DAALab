# What is Dijkastras Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other. It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined. For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities and edge path costs represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road (for simplicity, ignore red lights, stop signs, toll roads and other obstructions), Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. A widely used application of shortest path algorithm is network routing protocols, most notably IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). It is also employed as a subroutine in other algorithms such as Johnson's.

The Dijkstra algorithm uses labels that are positive integers or real numbers, which are totally ordered. It can be generalized to use any labels that are partially ordered, provided the subsequent labels (a subsequent label is produced when traversing an edge) are monotonically non-decreasing. This generalization is called the generic Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm.

Dijkstra's algorithm uses a data structure for storing and querying partial solutions sorted by distance from the start. While the original algorithm uses a min-priority queue and runs in time

The idea of this algorithm is also given in Leyzorek et al. 1957. Fredman & Tarjan 1984 propose using a Fibonacci heap min-priority queue to optimize the running time complexity to <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|E|&plus;|V|\log&space;|V|)}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|E|&plus;|V|\log&space;|V|)}" title="{\displaystyle \Theta (|E|+|V|\log |V|)}" /></a>. This is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights. However, specialized cases (such as bounded/integer weights, directed acyclic graphs etc.) can indeed be improved further as detailed in Specialized variants.

### Algorithm
Let the node at which we are starting be called the initial node. Let the distance of node Y be the distance from the initial node to Y. Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step.

* Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.
* Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Set the initial node as current.
* For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbours and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbour B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current value will be kept.
* When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbours of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.
* If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.
* Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new "current node", and go back to step 3.

When planning a route, it is actually not necessary to wait until the destination node is "visited" as above: the algorithm can stop once the destination node has the smallest tentative distance among all "unvisited" nodes (and thus could be selected as the next "current").

### Analysis
Bounds of the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with edges E and vertices V can be expressed as a function of the number of edges, denoted <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;|E|" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;|E|" title="|E|" /></a>, and the number of vertices, denoted <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;|E|" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;|E|" title="|V|" /></a>, using big-O notation. The complexity bound depends mainly on the data structure used to represent the set Q. In the following, upper bounds can be simplified because <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;|E|" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;|E|" title="|E|" /></a> is <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;\Theta&space;(|V|^{2})" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;\Theta&space;(|V|^{2})" title="\Theta (|V|^{2})" /></a> for any graph, but that simplification disregards the fact that in some problems, other upper bounds on <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;|E|" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;|E|" title="|E|" /></a> may hold.

For any data structure for the vertex set Q, the running time is in

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|E|\cdot&space;T_{\mathrm&space;{dk}&space;}&plus;|V|\cdot&space;T_{\mathrm&space;{em}&space;})}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|E|\cdot&space;T_{\mathrm&space;{dk}&space;}&plus;|V|\cdot&space;T_{\mathrm&space;{em}&space;})}" title="{\displaystyle \Theta (|E|\cdot T_{\mathrm {dk} }+|V|\cdot T_{\mathrm {em} })}" /></a>,
where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;T_{\mathrm&space;{dk}&space;}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;T_{\mathrm&space;{dk}&space;}" title="T_{\mathrm {dk} }" /></a> and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;T_{\mathrm&space;{em}&space;}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;T_{\mathrm&space;{em}&space;}" title="T_{\mathrm {em} }" /></a> are the complexities of the decrease-key and extract-minimum operations in Q, respectively. The simplest version of Dijkstra's algorithm stores the vertex set Q as an ordinary linked list or array, and extract-minimum is simply a linear search through all vertices in Q. In this case, the running time is <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|E|&plus;|V|^{2})=\Theta&space;(|V|^{2})}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|E|&plus;|V|^{2})=\Theta&space;(|V|^{2})}" title="{\displaystyle \Theta (|E|+|V|^{2})=\Theta (|V|^{2})}" /></a>.

If the graph is stored as an adjacency list, the running time for a dense graph (i.e., where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;|E|\in&space;\Theta&space;(|V|^{2})}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;|E|\in&space;\Theta&space;(|V|^{2})}" title="{\displaystyle |E|\in \Theta (|V|^{2})}" /></a>) <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;((|V|^{2})\log&space;|V|)}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;((|V|^{2})\log&space;|V|)}" title="{\displaystyle \Theta ((|V|^{2})\log |V|)}" /></a>.
For sparse graphs, that is, graphs with far fewer than <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;|V|^{2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;|V|^{2}" title="|V|^{2}" /></a> edges, Dijkstra's algorithm can be implemented more efficiently by storing the graph in the form of adjacency lists and using a self-balancing binary search tree, binary heap, pairing heap, or Fibonacci heap as a priority queue to implement extracting minimum efficiently. To perform decrease-key steps in a binary heap efficiently, it is necessary to use an auxiliary data structure that maps each vertex to its position in the heap, and to keep this structure up to date as the priority queue Q changes. With a self-balancing binary search tree or binary heap, the algorithm requires <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;\Theta&space;((|E|&plus;|V|)\log&space;|V|)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;\Theta&space;((|E|&plus;|V|)\log&space;|V|)" title="\Theta ((|E|+|V|)\log |V|)" /></a> time in the worst case (where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;\log" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;\log" title="\log" /></a>  denotes the binary logarithm <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;\log&space;_{2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;\log&space;_{2}" title="\log _{2}" /></a>); for connected graphs this time bound can be simplified to 
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;\Theta&space;(|E|\log&space;|V|)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;\Theta&space;(|E|\log&space;|V|)" title="\Theta (|E|\log |V|)" /></a>. The Fibonacci heap improves this to <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|E|&plus;|V|\log&space;|V|).}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|E|&plus;|V|\log&space;|V|).}" title="{\displaystyle \Theta (|E|+|V|\log |V|).}" /></a>
When using binary heaps, the average case time complexity is lower than the worst-case: assuming edge costs are drawn independently from a common probability distribution, the expected number of decrease-key operations is bounded by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|V|\log(|E|/|V|))}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;\Theta&space;(|V|\log(|E|/|V|))}" title="{\displaystyle \Theta (|V|\log(|E|/|V|))}" /></a>, giving a total running time of: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;O\left(|E|&plus;|V|\log&space;{\frac&space;{|E|}{|V|}}\log&space;|V|\right).}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\fn_phv&space;{\displaystyle&space;O\left(|E|&plus;|V|\log&space;{\frac&space;{|E|}{|V|}}\log&space;|V|\right).}" title="{\displaystyle O\left(|E|+|V|\log {\frac {|E|}{|V|}}\log |V|\right).}" /></a>
